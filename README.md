Implementation of [Successive Convexification: A Superlinearly Convergent Algorithm for Non-convex Optimal Control Problems
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06539) by Yuanqi Mao, Michael Szmuk and Behcet Acikmese

Reqires `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy` and `cvxpy`.


This framework provides an easy way to implement your own models.

Fixed- and free-final-time optimization is possible.

The following models are currently implemented:

- Rocket trajectory model with free-final-time based on

by Michael Szmuk and Behçet Açıkmeşe.
